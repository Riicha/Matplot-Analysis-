Multiple operation  &amp; Graphical representation of different scenarios on several data sets from Pharmaceutical Industry using Pandas libraries 
Analysis of the Pyber Data:-
1- Cities of the type Urban have a relative lower Avg Fare compared to the rural cities. This can also be infered from the distances of each ride. Rides are longer on the rural area since the desire locations are farther from the initial point of departure.
2- Number of drivers are lower in the Rural Cities. This could be due to the dense population in cities compared to rural cities, on the other hand, urban cities have a singnifcanlty higher number of drivers.
3- There seems to be an inverse relationship between the number of rides and the average fare, however the suburban cities have some intances where this asumption / analysis does not stand to be true.
